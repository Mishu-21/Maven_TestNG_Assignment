Run on specific one browser

Steps:
           1.Define 5 classes with few testcases in it 
                       as we have 5 classes so they must have some inheritance between them because agr inheritance nhi show kari toh mjhko har ek test case mai define krna hoga driver  ki kaunsa browser hai choose karo  so code resuablility nhi hogi theregore show inheritance and yha @Before annotation use karlo because yeh phle he ho jayega 
                       Therefore try to inherite 
                       and yeh dikkat cross browser mai aayegi yha single mai toh vhrome mai krdo sb define  
           2.In common class define 1 Annotation which is Parameter and pass browser which will tell that in which browser we are going to run our test cases 
           3.Now right click on project -->TestNG--->Convert to testNG 
               an xml file will be generated 
syntax:----------------
suite 
test 
classes
class
/classes
/test
/suite
              
 than  define paramter annotation inside  xml
                 and is declared after test 
Syntax:        suite 
               test
               <parameter name="browser" value="chrome"></parameter>
               classes
               class
               /classes
               /test
               /suite

           4.Now run xml file through testng
